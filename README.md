## Overview
This thesis explores the concept of **Cognitive Radar**, an intelligent radar system inspired by the echolocation mechanism used by bats and dolphins. The work focuses on how cognitive systems can dynamically adapt transmission and reception strategies for improved target tracking accuracy in complex environments. The study emphasizes **Kalman Filtering techniques** and their application in radar perception, modeling, and real-time tracking.

## Methodology
- Implemented **Kalman Filter (KF)** and compared performance across variants: **Extended KF, Unscented KF, and Cubature KF (CKF)**.  
- Conducted over **1000 recursive prediction–correction cycles** to evaluate convergence and minimize estimation error.  
- Simulated the **tracking of a two-link robotic arm** using CKF in MATLAB.  
- Applied **dynamic programming** at the transmitter for waveform optimization.  
- Designed **neural feedback models** to establish a perception–action cycle between receiver and transmitter, enabling cognitive adaptability.

## Key Findings
- **CKF achieved the lowest RMSE** and exhibited superior stability under non-linear dynamic conditions.  
- Cognitive feedback between radar transmitter and receiver improved **tracking accuracy and response adaptiveness**.  
- Demonstrated feasibility of CKF-based perception for **real-world target tracking** and defense radar systems.
